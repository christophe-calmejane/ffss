2) compile FFSS
3) use FFSS
4) get help


---------------------------
| 1) get FFSS             |
---------------------------
To get FFSS, you can use :

 * CVS: cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/FFSS/
 * samba: on machine orion
       from FLEMING (u-psud.fr)


---------------------------
| 2) compile FFSS        |
---------------------------
Before compiling FFSS, you must have these libraries installed
on your system :
libc (libc6)
libpthread (libpth12, libpth-dev)
libreadline (libreadline, libreadline-dev)
libz (zlib, zlib-devel), version >=1.0
libbz2 (optional but recommended and needed by the master)
lex + bison/yacc (flex, yacc - to compile the server)

There are 4 steps :

 a) compile the FFSS library
 b) compile the client
 c) compile the server (if needed)
 d) compile the master (if needed)

a) the library is in the directory libFFSS-1.0.0
b) the client is in the directory appli/client
c) the server is in the directory appli/server
d) the master is in the directory appli/master

The best way is to launch the build-* scripts in the root directory

Otherwise, you can compile manually :
For each one, go into the directory and type :
./configure
 possibly with options
make
make install (as root)


---------------------------
| 3) use FFSS        |
---------------------------

There are README files in the directory correspondant to the application.

---------------------------
| 4) get help             |
