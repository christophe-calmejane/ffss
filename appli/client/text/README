1) libraries nedded
--------------------

to install this client, you need:
	ffss lib (ffss/src)
		<http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffss>
	GNU readline lib
		<http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html>
	skyutils 1.11 or greater
		<http://zekiller.skytech.org>
	termcap lib (used by readline)


2) compilation
--------------

After having installed all of this, you can compile:
./configure
make
make install (as root)
see INSTALL for details


3) usage    
--------

so you will have an executable file in this directory named 'ffss-client'
you can move it where you want.

Usage:

ffss client uses a configuration file named 'ffss-client.conf'
It's by default in this directory, but you can specify a new location:
ffss-client -c (config-file)
for example: ffss-client -c /my/dir/ffss-client.conf

There's some others command-line options, type ffss-client --help

There's a 'help' command, if you want too :)

there's a domain none, it's used to broadcast, and access to the shares
even if a master cannot be reached.


4) Notes
--------

See the file FAQ-en in the FFSS's documentation.
